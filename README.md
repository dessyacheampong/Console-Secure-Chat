# Console-Secure-Chat

Console-Secure-Chat is a secure, console-based chat application. It enables encrypted communication between users via a command-line interface.

## Features
- Simple encryption using Caesar cipher (for now).
- Network communication using sockets.
- Console-based user interface.

## Build and Run
1. Install `gcc` or another C compiler.
2. Run `make` to compile the application.
3. Execute `./Console-Secure-Chat` to start the chat application.

## Roadmap
- Replace Caesar cipher with a more secure encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).
- Implement real-time messaging.
- Add multi-client support with threading.
- Improve error handling and security.
